# 7GUIs: A GUI Programming Benchmark - Implemented in plain React

This repository contains code for the 7 tasks of the [7GUIS-Challange](http://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/).
Each task folder contains a `discussion.md` file to talk about benefits and drawbacks of the provided solutions.

## Overall evaluation

Implementing this in plain React without any state-containers (like Redux or Mobx) has been really fun. For some tasks, small libraries had to be added to manage complex states or logics. Most of these libraries implement the observer pattern to connect the vanilla JS classes to the React Components.
